<p>
    As Steampunk is not the most widely known subculture, people who are interested in it could find it difficult to locate others who share their interest.
    That is why conventions have become a popular destination for people who wish to visit a Steampunk world filled with likeminded people. It is like stepping
    into an alternate dimension where the Victorian, retro-futuristic style of Steampunk has taken over.
</p>
<p>
    So what are you most likely to encounter upon stepping through the clockwork portal into this place? For starters what draws the eye more than anything
    else are the people themselves. For any Steampunk enthusiast one of the most important things to them is their wardrobe. A big part of what makes Steampunk
    so unique is the personas that each person creates for themselves using their clothing.
</p>
<p>
    Cosplayers will buy, salvage and build intricate outfits. Gear-powered prosthetic body parts and brass cog work accessories is the norm here. There are no
    set rules for what does and does not qualify as Steampunk as it has such diverse roots from the Victorian era to the Wild West. If it can be imagined and
    it looks cool you have done a good job.
</p>

<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p>
    Looking at some of the wondrous characters that have been created it is no wonder that Steampunk has been gaining more and more support as a subculture.
    People can see their own reflection in the polished brass pipes running through a person's backpack and what they see looking back at them is a flare of
    light bouncing off of their golden monocle. People portray themselves as airship pilots, barons, captains or pretty much anything else their heart desires.
    They then use these characters to role play.

<p>
    In role playing games each players' character has his or her own traits which influence their decisions and interactions within the group. Through series'
    of actions and events they build up a rich tapestry of stories. These stories then help to develop the personas even more and it is an infinite cycle
    resembling real life and how personalities are formed. Inside this world of cosplay this is real life. Players immerse themselves in the game for as long
    as it goes on sticking true to their characters mannerisms and attributes.
</p>
<h3>The Clothing</h3>
<p class="p_links">
    Getting back to the actual <strong><a href="apparel.html">costumes</a></strong> there are several crowd favourites that you will see again and again. Of course each time you see one it will have its
    own subtle nuances. By far the most popular outfit to be seen at any steampunk convention is the Victorian "lord of the manor" styled clothing. The classic
    tails and top hat look is taken and spruced up with goggles, leather straps and some shiny accessories. The next thing you're going to see is the airship pilot/mechanic who you will see most often with gear and steam powered equipment and sometimes even limbs! And we cannot forget all of the female Steampunkers out there either, with them you can see all of the same style choices as the men
    except they make it look better.
</p>
<h3>The Art</h3>
<p>
    Looking beyond the patrons and into the convention itself there is a wealth of things to explore. No matter what your Steampunk desire was when visiting
    the convention it will be catered to by someone if you look hard enough. A big part of these conventions are dedicated to exhibiting people's artwork and
    creations. A hobby of many Steampunkers is art. They will often find items in second hand shops, the internet and even dumps to turn them into a fantastic
    sculpture or item of clothing.
</p>
<p>
    Conventions allow artists to display their projects to others who will appreciate what they have achieved. These conventions play an important role in
    holding the Steampunk community together. If these people did not have a way of connecting to other likeminded individuals and could not get recognition
    for their artwork there is a strong possibility they could lose interest in the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
    Getting back to the art itself the exhibition centre's will take you on a trip to imaginary places where things that's should not exist are the only things
    around. With each new display you take a step further into the fantasy. Over the bustling sound of people there is a tink of metal meeting metal and the
    clicking of gears powering amazing machines. Some use this place as a means of selling their creations to earn money to feed their artwork.
</p>
<p>
    So if you wish to buy or sell an unusual piece of Steampunk paraphernalia the convention circuits could be the thing for you. I would find it hard to
    believe that in a gathering of hundreds of enthusiasts you could fail to find a buyer for that cool sculpture you have sitting around.
</p>
<p>
    Often the producers of well-known literature and film in the genre of Steampunk appear to talk about their work. But in this culture the content comes from
    within making each member a contributor. Everyone is equal here, no one is any more important than anyone else based on what they have created. There is a
    sense of mutual respect among every person as their contribution is acknowledged.
</p>
<h3>Where to go</h3>
<p>
    In Ireland and the UK there are an ever growing number of Steampunk enthusiasts wishing to connect with others to speak and play together. So where can you
    go if you are one of them? In Ireland the Steampunk scene is still developing but the gatherings and conventions are there, you just have to look for them.
</p>
<p>
    Often you won't find a convention dedicated solely to Steampunk in Ireland (you'll have to go a little bit further for that) but that doesn't mean that
    there is nothing out there. Steampunkers often play a strong role in other festivals and conventions i.e. Phoenix Convention and Gaelcon. And if you wish
    to observe rather than play games you have even more choices. Art festivals often contain displays partly or entirely dedicated to Steampunk. A Steampunk
    float even featured in Drogheda Arts Festival 2013.
</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>
    Whether you are a Steampunk role play veteran, a sculptor/artist or just a casual enthusiast looking for a good time conventions are definitely the way to
    go. There is a fantastic world that is always growing just waiting to be explored. The subculture of Steampunk is growing and with that more people are
    wishing to connect at conventions and gatherings. Facebook and Twitter are a great way to meet people who may be in the know if you struggle to find the
    convention for you and if after that you are still not satisfied start your own! Someone has to be the one to take the initiative and bring the Irish
    branch of this rich subculture to the next level. Why not be a part of it?
