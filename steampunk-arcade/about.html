        	<h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
    Do you live feel that the modern fashion and lifestyles lack the elegancy and sensibilities of the centuries long past? Do you yearn for the wonder and
    optimism of the Victorian Era, when the world was still full of wonder and people were looking into the future with hope and optimism?
</p>
<p>
    You are not alone.
</p>
<p>
    Four avid steampunk fans created SteamPunk Arcade in May of 2013. Their aim was to popularise the Steampunk genre and the sub-culture they strongly
    admired.
</p>
<p>
    While still fairly new on the Internet, we aim to provide our visitors with the beginner's information on what steampunk is, and point them in the right
    direction if they wish to find out more and immerse themselves deeper in the steampunk subculture.
</p>
<p>
    We also aim to create website which would serve as a hub for people who have been in steampunk for a long time, and help them find new people who also
    share their interests, as well as organise thematic events and conventions.
</p>
<p>
    We maintain contact with a number of steampunk groups both in Ireland and abroad, and they are always happy to lend new steampun enthusiasts to find what
    they need and provide them with any information about the subculture.
</p>
<p>
    We also aim to support and advertise local establishments which support the steampunk movements, such as steampunk markets and cabaret.
</p>
<p>
    Last, but definitely not the least, we want to help people have as much fun as they can.
</p>
<p>
    We have big plans for the future, and hope to find new ways to inform people of steampunk and accomodate the needs of those who are already a part of this
    sub-culture.
</p>
<p>
    We are always looking for more people to join us in our noble cause.
</p>
<p>
    If you are interested in joining the moderation team of the website, or have any inquiries, feel free to contact us.
