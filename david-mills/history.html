    	<h2>History</h2>
    
    	<p>After killing the murder Mills was put on suspended paid leave until the court case was over. The press at first talked about murders and called them the "Murders of the Seven Deadly Sins". However as more and more information got out about mills they slowly stopped reporting it. A few months later the trail was held in a quite court room, with only a few higher ups in the department watching the proceedings. Mills was judged to have killed "John Doe" in self-defence and had all charges dropped. </p>
        <p>
While waiting for the court case David moved in with William while he was looking for a new place to live. He sent his 3 dogs to live with his parents back home. </p>
<p>
The guilt of his wife's death was heavy on David's heart and on more than one occasion put him close to taking how own life. If it wasn't for William looking out for him many believe David would have never made it. </p>
<p>
After the court case David left the city and moved back home to work in his old department. A few years went by and David started to rebuild his life. William moved to the same town as William and the two became very close friends. </p>
