			<h2>Introduction to Behaviourism</h2>
			<p><strong>Behaviourism</strong> is a <strong>school of thought</strong> that operates on a principle of a "stimulus-response". It postulates that all behaviour is caused by external stimuli (operant conditioning). It was the primary paradigm in psychology between 1920s to 1950 and is based on a number of underlying assumptions regarding methodology and behavioural analysis. Behaviourism assumes that a learner is <strong>essentially passive</strong>, responding to environmental stimuli.The learner stats off as a clean slate (i.e. tabula rasa) and behaviour is shaped through positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement.</p>

			<p>All behaviour can be explained without the need to consider internal mental states or consciousnesses.
			</p>
			<p>There is little difference between the learning that takes place in humans and that in other animals. Therefore research can be carried out on animals as well as humans.
				In essence, it states that <strong>people have no free will</strong> – a person’s environment determines their behaviour.</p>
